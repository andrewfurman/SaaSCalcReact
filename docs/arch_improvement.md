‚óè Based on my analysis, here are the main refactoring options to improve maintainability:

  State Management Options

  1. Context API + useReducer - Replace prop drilling with centralized state management
  2. Custom Hooks - Extract business logic into reusable hooks like useCostCalculations
  3. Separate UI/Business State - Keep tab state separate from calculation state

  Component Structure Options

  1. Extract Reusable Components - Create SliderInput, CalculationCard, CostDisplay components
  2. Split Large Components - Break down 200+ line components into smaller, focused ones
  3. Create Layout Components - Standardize the grid/card layouts used across all views

  Code Organization Options

  1. Utility Functions - Move duplicate formatCurrency and calculations to shared utilities
  2. Business Logic Layer - Extract all calculations into pure functions separate from UI
  3. Constants File - Move hardcoded values (min/max, defaults) to a constants file

  Architecture Options

  1. Feature-based Structure - Organize by features (salesforce/, 8090/, comparison/)
  2. Hooks-based Architecture - Use custom hooks for all business logic
  3. Component Library Approach - Create a design system with reusable components

  Priority Recommendations

  Quick Wins (Low Risk):
  - Extract formatCurrency utility function
  - Fix tab state synchronization issue
  - Create constants file for hardcoded values

  Medium Impact:
  - Implement Context API to eliminate prop drilling
  - Extract common components (SliderInput, CalculationCard)
  - Separate business logic from UI components

  Long-term (High Impact):
  - Restructure into feature-based folders
  - Implement comprehensive custom hooks
  - Add input validation and error handling

  Would you like me to elaborate on any of these options or start with a specific refactoring approach?
